        <h3>These are the original cover art paperbacks, which I personally think are the best. Since Netflix is pushing their cover art, these are
            harder to find and may be slightly more expensive. I'll understand if you choose the cheaper option.

        <p>*This one is optional, as it was written years after the ending of the books. It reads a bit more like game Geralt than book Geralt,
            which may feel weird to some readers. Also, it takes place sometime in the midst of the events of The Last Wish (the book not the short
            story).
