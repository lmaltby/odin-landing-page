        <p>
            This is Geralt of Rivia, the Witcher, and unwilling hero of the story. 
            Witchers are created using magic potions and mutagens, to make them more 
            suited to killing monsters than normal humans are. Despite the important 
            trade Witchers work, they are looked down upon as mutants and freaks. 
        </p>
        <img src="./content-images/yennefer.jpg" alt="Yennefer the Sorceress">
        <p>
            This is Yennefer of Vengerberg. She is a powerful sorceress, former
            advisor to a king, and one of the 13 of The Hill from the battle of Sodden.
            Thanks to a hastily and poorly worded wish, Yen and Geralt are bound 
            together by destiny.
        </p>
        <img src="./content-images/ciri.jpg" alt="Ciri, Lady of Space and Time">
        <p>
            This is Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, Princess of Cintra. Ciri is on the run 
            from the Emperor of Nilfgard who, for reasons unknown, wants her captured 
            at all costs. She is the adoptive daughter of Geralt and Yennefer, brought
            to Geralt through the Law of Surprise, or perhaps, by destiny.
        </p>
        <img src="./content-images/roach.jpg" alt="Roach, Geralt's loyal mare">
        <p>
            This is Roach. Roach is every single horse that Geralt has ever had. He refuses 
            to name a horse anything else, regardless if the horse is a stallion or mare
            (though the current Roach, if you count the games, is a mare).

        <p>“Evil is Evil. Lesser, greater, middling… Makes no difference. 
            The degree is arbitrary. The definition’s blurred. 
            If I’m to choose between one evil and another… I’d rather not choose at all.”

<!-- pull header from exercises, should be easy from there. Don't forget to make -->
<!-- the links part of ul, li, and a while addressing the bullet points and underline -->

<!-- use flex-direction: column; to achieve the 5 vertical sections -->

<!-- top left section is literally the formatting of the modal -->

<!-- random info section also right out of the flexbox exercises -->

<!-- is the quote text or image? Will change formatting drastically -->

<!-- call to action similar to modal. Should be two divs, left one much wider.  -->
<!-- Maybe the text is two vertical divs within the larger div? -->

<!-- just pull the footer from the exercises and then tweak it -->
