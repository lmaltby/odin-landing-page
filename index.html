//pull header from exercises, should be easy from there. Don't forget to make
//the links part of ul, li, and a while addressing the bullet points and underline

//use flex-direction: column; to achieve the 5 vertical sections

//top left section is literally the formatting of the modal

//random info section also right out of the flexbox exercises

//is the quote text or image? Will change formatting drastically

//call to action similar to modal. Should be two divs, left one much wider. 
//Maybe the text is two vertical divs within the larger div?

//just pull the footer from the exercises and then tweak it
